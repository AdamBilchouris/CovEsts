\title{Moving Block Bootstrap Samples}
\usage{
bootstrap_samples(X, l, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A vector representing observed values of the time series.}

\item{l}{The block length considered for bootstrap.}

\item{k}{The number of blocks considered for bootstrap.}
}
\value{
A vector of length \code{length(X)} whose values are a bootstrapped time series.
}
\description{
This function generates moving block bootstrap samples.
}
\details{
This function generates a moving block bootstrap sample for a time series \eqn{X.}
For some times series \eqn{X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{n},} construct \eqn{k \in Z} overlapping blocks of the form
\eqn{B_{i} = (X_{i}, \dots, X_{i + \ell - 1}),} where \eqn{\ell \in [1, n]} is the block length.
Randomly sample, with replacement, from the discrete uniform distribution with on \eqn{\{1, \dots, n - \ell + 1\}} to obtain a set of random block locations \eqn{I_{1}, \dots, I_{k}.}
Construct a bootstrapped time series \eqn{X_{1}^{\ast}, X_{2}^{\ast}, \dots, X_{n}^{\ast}} where \eqn{X_{i}^{\ast} = B_{I_{i}}.}
The bootstrapped time series is truncated to have an observation window of size \eqn{n.}
